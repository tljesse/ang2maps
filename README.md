# Ang2maps

This is a demo project for [BugReplay](https://www.bugreplay.com/) to show how to debug an Angular project with Google Maps using their service.

## Configuration

You'll need to set you Google Maps API key in 'app.module.ts' which is discussed in the blog post

## Other Tools

You'll need the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) to get things running on your system
This also uses [Angular Google Maps](https://angular-maps.com/)
